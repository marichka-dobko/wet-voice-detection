# Wet Voice Detection
In collaboration with Sara Albert and The Laryngology Innovation Lab led by Dr. Ana√Øs Rameau.  

Machine Learning techniques to accurately predict swallowing difficulties in patients by analyzing the alterations in their voice and speech patterns before and after they swallow water.

This project involves the collection and meticulous processing of voice and speech data from a diverse cohort of patients who have already undergone objective swallow evaluations through standard clinical procedures. This private dataset is used to train a supervised ML model. By utilizing various ML algorithms and feature extraction techniques, the model is developed to identify and quantify subtle changes in speech that are indicative of swallowing difficulties. This could potentially aid in early diagnosis and enhance therapeutic strategies. Ultimately improving the quality of diagnosis for those affected by such conditions.
